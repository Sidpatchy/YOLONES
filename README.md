I saw [this video](https://youtu.be/oYjYmSniQyM) about Nintendo's NES emulator accuracy. It was a very interesting
watch. However, it gave me the motivation I needed to make my own NES emulator. I've been wanting to learn more about
the low-level operations of a CPU for a while, and I figured writing a basic NES emulator couldn't be too hard. As 
IntelliJ Idea was already open on my computer, I decided to write it in Java (also I just like Java).

Not planning on making this anything particularly accurate. Mostly just a project for learning emulators and hardware 
a bit better.
